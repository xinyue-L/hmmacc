Description: This package includes the functions to apply the Hidden Markov Model-Based Unsupervised Sleep/Wake Identification Algorithm Using Actigraphy. The package is especially helpful when raw actigraph data are unavailable and summary count data are used. It takes accelerometer/actigraph data and output sleep information for downstream analysis.
